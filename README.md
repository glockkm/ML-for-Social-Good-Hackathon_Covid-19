# ML-for-Social-Good-Hackathon_Covid-19


## Project Description
This repository is the code used to measure and understand the Socio and Economic effects of COVID 19 Pandemic on the United States household population. A 2020 Household survey having questionaire ranging from employment status,Spending to Wellness has been organized by various agencies over a period of 12 weeks to understand the impact of 
ongoing COVID 19 pandemic.The survey is done to provide post pandemic recovery. 

Our goal is to use  ML models and  predict depression or anxiety in someone using responses (attributes) to weekly survey questions during a pandemic (and assign a higher risk therefore early intervention etc.). This could possibly help the person with regards to substance abuse, suicide and such. Suicide rates have skyrocketed during the pandemic unfortunately.
