# Predicting Mental Health for Early Intervention during a Pandemic using Census Survey Data


## Project Description
The U.S Census Bureau has been sending out weekly surveys to the U.S. population during the Covid-19 pandemic. They are trying to understand the Socio and economic effects of a Pandemic on the United States household population. I want to harness this data and use machine learning to predict anxiety and depression using correlated attributes from these weekly survey responses. Suicide has skyrocketd during the pandemic as well as substance abuse and domestic violence cases. See links below.

## Problem Statement
Can we predict anxiety or depression using survey responses from a survey filled out weekly for 123 weeks during a pandemic? I will look at a random forest model and a SVM model to see which outputs better results.

## Data Source
2020 Household Pulse Survey, U.S. Census Bureau. It's data collected from weekly surveys having questions ranging from employment status, spending, health status, job status, food availability, mental well being and more. I used weeks 7, 9 and 12 for my dataset.

## Aim and Relevance
If we can predict anxiety or depression during a pandemic, we may be able to assign a higher risk value to an individual which may lead to early intervention. This could possibly help with prevention in regards to substance abuse, suicide and domestic violence.
